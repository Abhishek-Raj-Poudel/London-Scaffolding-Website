## Project Overview

Kensington is home to some of London's most beautiful period properties. We were entrusted with providing the access solutions for a major restoration project of a Grade II listed townhouse. This required a delicate touch and a deep understanding of historical architecture.

## Our Approach

Our team designed a bespoke scaffolding system that provided full access to the building's facade without causing any damage to the sensitive historical fabric. We used protective measures and specialized attachments to ensure the integrity of the structure was maintained throughout the restoration process.

- **Heritage Protection:** Specialized scaffolding techniques for listed buildings.
- **Bespoke Design:** Tailored solutions for complex architectural features.
- **Kensington Experts:** Specialist knowledge of local restoration requirements.
