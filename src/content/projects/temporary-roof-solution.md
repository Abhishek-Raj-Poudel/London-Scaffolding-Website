## Project Overview

A residential block in Croydon required a complete roof replacement. To ensure the building and its residents remained protected from the elements throughout the duration of the works, we provided a full-scale temporary roof solution.

## Our Approach

We designed and installed a weather-protected temporary roof system that covered the entire footprint of the residential block. This allowed the roofing contractors to work in all weather conditions, significantly reducing the project timeline and providing peace of mind to the residents below.

## Key Features

- **Weather Protection:** Robust temporary roofing for uninterrupted work.
- **Residential Focus:** Minimizing disruption and ensuring safety for residents.
- **Croydon Deployment:** Efficient service for major regional projects.
- **Full Coverage:** Complete protection for the entire building structure.
