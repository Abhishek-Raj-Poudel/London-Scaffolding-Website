## Prioritize Safety with Independent Scaffold Inspections

Safety is non-negotiable in the scaffolding industry. Our independent scaffold inspection services in London provide peace of mind for site managers, contractors, and property owners, ensuring that all structures remain safe and compliant throughout their use.

### Legal Requirements for Scaffolding

Under the Work at Height Regulations 2005, it is a legal requirement to ensure that scaffolding is inspected by a competent person. Failure to do so can lead to severe penalties and, more importantly, put lives at risk.

- **Weekly Inspections:** Routine checks to ensure the structure hasn't shifted or been tampered with.
- **Post-Weather Checks:** Inspections following high winds, heavy rain, or snow.
- **Handover Certificates:** Initial inspections conducted before the scaffolding is first used.

### Our Rigorous Inspection Process

Our qualified inspectors follow a comprehensive checklist to identify potential hazards and ensure complete compliance.

1.  **Foundations & Base Plates:** Checking for stability and proper load distribution.
2.  **Structural Integrity:** Verifying that all joints, ties, and braces are secure.
3.  **Working Platforms:** Ensuring boards are correctly positioned and secured.
4.  **Edge Protection:** Checking that guardrails and toe-boards meet height requirements.
5.  **Access Points:** Verifying that ladders and stair towers are safe to use.
