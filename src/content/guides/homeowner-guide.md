Planning a loft conversion or roof repair? You'll likely need scaffolding. This guide covers the process from start to finish.

## Do I need a permit?

If the scaffolding is entirely on your property, you do not need a permit. However, if it encroaches on a public pavement or road, a license from the local council is required. We handle this process for you.

## How long does installation take?

For a standard terraced house front, erection typically takes 2-4 hours. Complex projects or detached properties may take a full day.

## What about security?

We recommend removing ladders at the end of each day or installing a ladder guard to prevent unauthorized access. We can also provide alarmed systems for extra peace of mind.

## Cost Factors

The price depends on:

1. Size of the structure
2. Duration of hire
3. Complexity (bridging over conservatories, etc.)
