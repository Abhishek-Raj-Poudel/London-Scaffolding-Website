Safety is our number one priority at London Scaffolding. Whether you are a homeowner or a site manager, understanding the basics of scaffolding safety is crucial.

## 1. Inspect Daily

Scaffolding should be inspected before every shift. Look for:

- Loose connections
- Missing guardrails
- Uneven base plates

## 2. Weight Limits

Never exceed the maximum intended load of the scaffold platform. Our designs clearly state the weight limits for each structure.

## 3. Weather Conditions

Avoid using scaffolding during high winds or storms. Wet surfaces can be slippery, so ensure appropriate footwear is worn at all times.
