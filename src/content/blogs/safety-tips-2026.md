In the high-stakes environment of London's construction industry, safety isn't just a checkbox—it's the foundation of every successful project. With the density of the city and the height of its structures, scaffolding safety requires a rigorous adherence to the latest industry standards and regulations.

## Understanding SG4:22 and TG20:21

For any professional scaffolding operation in the UK, two sets of guidelines are paramount: **SG4:22** (Preventing Falls from Scaffolding) and **TG20:21** (Guide to Good Practice for Tube and Fitting Scaffolding).

- **SG4:22 Compliance:** This industry standard focuses on the "Safe Zone" for scaffolders. It requires the use of collective protection (like temporary guardrails) or personal fall protection equipment (PFPE) at all times during the erection, alteration, and dismantling of scaffolds.
- **TG20:21 Operational Brand:** This provides the technical 'standard configurations' for scaffolding. If a scaffold falls outside these standard designs, a bespoke structural calculation from a qualified engineer is mandatory.

## The Hierarchy of Inspection

Safety doesn't end once the scaffold is built. Regular inspections are a legal requirement under the Work at Height Regulations 2005.

### 1. Handover Inspections

Before any trade steps onto the boards, a competent person must inspect the structure and issue a **Handover Certificate**. This confirms the scaffold has been built to the correct design and is fit for purpose.

### 2. Statutory 7-Day Inspections

Scaffolds must be re-inspected at least **every seven days**. In London, where wind tunnels between skyscrapers can be significant, we often recommend more frequent checks for high-rise structures.

### 3. Post-Event Inspections

Following any event that could affect the stability of the scaffold—such as high winds (common in coastal-facing London districts) or accidental vehicle impact—an immediate inspection is required before work resumes.

## Managing the Public Interface

Many London projects occur directly above busy pavements. In these scenarios, safety protocols must extend beyond the workers to the general public:

- **Brick Guards and Netting:** To prevent debris or tools from falling.
- **Double Boarding with Plywood/Plastic Sheeting:** To create a dust-proof and liquid-proof barrier.
- **Fan Guards:** Cantilevered protection platforms designed to catch any falling objects before they reach street level.
- **Lighting and Signage:** Ensuring the structure is visible and clearly marked 24/7.

## The 'Scafftag' System

At London Scaffolding, we utilize the Scafftag system at every access point.

- **Green Tag:** The structure is safe to use.
- **Red Tag:** "Do Not Use"—this is applied during erection, dismantling, or if a defect is found.

## Conclusion

A safe site is a productive site. By choosing a contractor that lives and breathes these safety standards, you protect your workers, the public, and your project's reputation.
