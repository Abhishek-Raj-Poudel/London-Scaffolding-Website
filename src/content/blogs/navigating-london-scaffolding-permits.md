When your project requires scaffolding to be placed on a public highway or pavement in London, you can't just set up and start work. Navigating the regulatory landscape of London's 32 boroughs requires careful planning and a clear understanding of the permitting process.

## Why Do You Need a License?

Under the Highways Act 1980, any structure placed on a public road or pavement must be licensed by the local Highway Authority. This ensures that:

- Pedestrian and traffic flow is managed safely.
- Emergency services retain access.
- Public safety is maintained through proper lighting and signage.

## The Application Process

In most cases, the scaffolding contractor (like London Scaffolding) must apply for the permit on behalf of the client. This is because the contractor holds the necessary Public Liability Insurance and safety accreditation required by the councils.

### Key Requirements usually include:

1. **Public Liability Insurance:** Typically a minimum of £10 million coverage.
2. **Detailed Site Plan:** Showing the exact footprint of the scaffold.
3. **Risk Assessment & Method Statement (RAMS):** Detailing how the structure will be safely erected and dismantled.
4. **Lighting & Guarding:** Ensuring the scaffold is visible at night (taped and lit).

## Borough Variations

One of the biggest challenges in London is that every council has its own set of rules and fee structures. For example:

- **Westminster & Camden:** Often require specific hoarding requirements and out-of-hours erection to avoid peak traffic.
- **Southwark & Lambeth:** Have strict guidelines regarding the depth of the scaffold on narrow pavements.

## Timelines and Costs

Permit approval can take anywhere from **5 to 10 working days**, depending on the borough. Fees also vary significantly, often including a standard application fee plus a weekly or monthly 'occupation' charge.
